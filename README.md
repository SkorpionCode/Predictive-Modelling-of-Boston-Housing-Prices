### Predictive-Modelling-of-Boston-Housing-Prices

The code is in the jupyter notebook with clear comments

In this project, we analyzed the housing prices in Boston by working with the Boston Housing 
Dataset from Kaggle [1]. Our objective was to accurately predict the median house value 
based on the provided input features. We successfully addressed missing data, mitigated 
skewness in feature distributions, and conducted correlation analyses to guide feature selection 
judiciously. Dimensionality reduction strategies were employed to gain a deeper 
understanding of the dataset.
The model training phase involved a training linear regression model, whose performance was 
assessed based on the MSE, RMSE and R-squared scores. Then we analyzed the performance 
of our linear regression model by comparing it with other regressor models like the Decision 
Tree Regressor and the Random Forest Regresso
